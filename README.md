### Description
Documentation for setting up Git, create/connect a GitHub account, installing Atom editor and installing Git-Plus package for Git commands without terminal.

#### 1. Install Atom
Head over to the [Atom](https://atom.io/) website and click the download button on the front page. Once downloaded open the `.zip` file and it should un-pack itself.  Once un-packed, you can open Atom and use it.

#### 2. Create/Connect GitHub account
Head over to the [GitHub join page](https://github.com/join) and make a Free account.  If you choose to you could go through the steps of checking, generating, and adding an [SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/) to GitHub so that Atom will not prompt for credentials every time you push to GitHub.  This is not necessary by any means but it does make workflow a lot faster.
